**Preamble (delete this section after reading)**
The OpenROAD project's goal is to enable no-human-in-loop (NHIL) design, with 24-hour turnaround time and eventual zero loss of power-performance-area (PPA) design quality. This is our top priority for the duration of the DARPA IDEA program (through July 2021). However, we also want to ensure that this software is accessible, reliable, and meets the needs of the EDA community. We already have many features planned, but requests from the community are welcome.
